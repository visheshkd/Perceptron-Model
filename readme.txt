Objective : Implementing the Perceptron model, similar to python machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn
Programming Language : Python 3.7
IDE : ANACONDA 3(Spyder)

Methods Implemented :

_initialize_weights - This is where you create the weights for your model (bias is included in
the weights).

initialize_all_weights_to_zeros - This method initializes all weights to zero (bias is
included in the weights).

predict - Given array of inputs this method predicts array of corresponding outputs.

print_weights - This method prints the weight matrix (bias is included in the weights).

train - Given array of inputs, desired outputs as on-hot array, and the learning rate, this method
adjusts the weights using Perceptron learning rule.

calculate_percent_error - Given array of inputs and desired outputs as on-hot array this
method calculates percent error.
